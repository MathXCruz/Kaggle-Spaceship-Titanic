# Spaceship Titanic

This project shows my solution to the [Spaceship Titanic Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic/overview).

I'm updating this repo with every submission I make, to record how I got to each score.

 - **Submission 1 [Score = 0.80243]:** the focus was 100% on the EDA and Feature Engineering. I used a GradientBoostClassifier with no hyperparameter tuning.

 - **Submission 2 [Score = 0.80336]:** Added a few more ML models to compare the results and also hyperparamter-tuning with cross validation for the model that best performed.

 _Next steps: model blending/stacking and feature engineering refinement._
